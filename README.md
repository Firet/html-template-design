## 🔵 Design.
This app is a template design for a video game items webpage.

## Features
- It was made with Next j, using typescript.
- Neither bootstrap nor tailwind was used, as pure CSS as possible.
- With flexbox I ensured that it looks good on different types of devices: big screens🖥️, cell phones📱 and laptops💻.
- The visual elements were tested in several browsers.
- I ran prettier to make the code consistent throughout the application.

## Folder structure
- /components: here are the components, they are organized in subfolders according to the Atomic Design principles.
- In global.css there are the global style variables
- The interfaces were defined within the components, no separate folder was used.

## 🏃‍♂️How to run this app?

🚀 First, make sure that you have node js installed, and then launch the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

💻 Finally, you can open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
